Kernel functional form  lifted from thesis by Niklas WahlstrÃ¶m

Attempted implementation of his kernel function. 

Each point has its own 3d vector output, at which 
you decompose into x, y and z components. Really 
unsure as to how I will go about decomosing this, 
but we will see.

    Should be a divergence and curl free vector field which you get from here. There surely arent that 
    many of these, so this will hopefully quickly look like a magnetic field.
